# Epidemic-Simulation
This project was part of my EEE498 course. The objective was to simulate an epidemic by implementing our own ODE34 method, based on the Runge-Kutta method. 

The model of the simulation is based off this article: Bj√∏rnstad, O.N., Shea, K., Krzywinski, M. and Altman, N.S., 2020. The SEIRS model for infectious disease dynamics. Nature methods, 17(6), pp.557-558.

## Myode34.m
The main fil were the code runs

## f.m
Contains the f function that contains the model for the simulation

## RungeKutta3Stages.m
The implmentation of the Runge-Kutta method with 3 stages.

## RungeKutta4Stages.m
The implmentation of the Runge-Kutta method with 4 stages.
