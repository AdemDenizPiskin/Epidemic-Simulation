# Epidemic-Simulation
This project was part of my EEE498 course. The objective was to simulate an epidemic by implementing our own ODE34 method. 

The model of the simulation is based off this article: Bj√∏rnstad, O.N., Shea, K., Krzywinski, M. and Altman, N.S., 2020. The SEIRS model for infectious disease dynamics. Nature methods, 17(6), pp.557-558.
